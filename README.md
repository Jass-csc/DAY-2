# DAY-2
I am Jaskiran kaur from department of 'COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING'. Today is my second day of training in second year of B-Tech (Computer Science Engineering). Here's the experience of DAY-2 in Training.
Today, on my second day of B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) training, we delved into some core concepts, starting with Booting and its types.

Booting

Booting is the process of starting your computer and loading the operating system (like Linux) so you can use it.

Types of Booting:

    Cold/Hard Boot: This refers to starting a computer from a completely powered-off state. Think of it as a "fresh" start.

    Warm/Soft Boot: This involves restarting a computer without completely cutting off the power, often done through the operating system (e.g., clicking "restart").

Understanding the Kernel

Our professor introduced the concept of the Kernel using a great analogy of a chef in a restaurant. Imagine a chef who prepares all the food in the restaurant, but guests never see them. The chef is the one actually making the food, while the waiter serves it to the guests.

In this analogy:

    The Chef plays the role of the Kernel.

    The Waiter plays the role of the Shell.

    The Kitchen utensils and vegetables used by the chef represent the Hardware.

In technical terms, the Kernel in Linux is the core component of the operating system. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and software, managing system resources and enabling communication between them.
here is the diagram of linux shell, that includes kernel, shell, hardware and user:

The professor also mentioned the term MOM, which stands for "Minutes of Meeting."

The Shell: Your Interface to the OS

We then learned about the Shell, which is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system. It works like a translator: you type commands, and the shell passes them through to the operating system.

Types of Shells:

    bash

    sh

    zsh

    fish

Among these, the bash shell is commonly used in projects because it's considered user-friendly and easy to use for issuing commands.

Categories of Shell:

    Command Line Shell: In this category, you interact with the system by typing commands.

    Graphical Line Shell (GUI Shell): In this category, you use a graphical interface (like icons and windows) to interact with the system.

Linux File Structure and Commands

After discussing the Linux shell, our professor explained the File Structure in Linux. This structure organizes how files and directories are arranged on the system.

Finally, we covered several essential Linux Commands:

    ls: Lists the contents of a directory.

    whoami: Displays the current username.

    date: Shows the current date and time.

    cd: Changes the current directory.

        Syntax: cd directory_name

    mkdir: Creates a new directory.

        Syntax: mkdir directory_name

    cat: Used to create a file with content, view file content, or concatenate files.

        Syntax: cat > filename (to create a file and add content; press Ctrl+D to save and exit)

    touch: Creates an empty file.

        Syntax: touch filename

    cp: Copies files from one location to another.

        Syntax: cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt

    pwd: Prints the current working directory.

        Syntax: pwd

    whereis: Locates the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.

        Syntax: whereis command_name (e.g., whereis cat)

    whatis: Provides a brief one-line description of a command.

        Syntax: whatis command_name (e.g., whatis cat)

    mv: Moves or renames files.

        Syntax: mv old_filename.txt new_filename.txt

After the lecture, we were given a task to practice these commands in Linux and take screenshots of our work.
